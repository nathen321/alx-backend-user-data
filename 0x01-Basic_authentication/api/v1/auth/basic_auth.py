of the base Auth class. It serves as a starting point for implementing
Basic Authentication in an API system.

    Basic Authentication Class
    
    Inherits from the base Auth class to provide Basic Authentication
    functionality. Currently serves as a placeholder for future implementation
    of Basic Authentication methods.
    
    Basic Authentication typically involves:
    - Extracting credentials from the Authorization header
    - Decoding base64-encoded credentials
    - Validating username and password
    
    Note: This is currently a skeleton implementation (pass statement)
    that will need to be expanded with actual authentication logic.
